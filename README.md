# NVIDIA Nemotron Parse v1.1 Overview

NVIDIA Nemotron Parse v1.1 is designed to understand document semantics and extract text and tables elements with spatial grounding. Given an image, NVIDIA Nemotron Parse v1.1 produces structured annotations, including formatted text, bounding-boxes and the corresponding semantic classes, ordered according to the document's reading flow. It overcomes the shortcomings of traditional OCR technologies that struggle with complex document layouts with structural variability, and helps transform unstructured documents into actionable and machine-usable representations. This has several downstream benefits such as increasing the availability of training-data for Large Language Models (LLMs), improving the accuracy of extractor, curator, retriever and AI agentic applications, and enhancing document understanding pipelines.

This model is ready for commercial use.

  - NVIDIA Nemotron Parse v1.1 output format is a string which encodes text content (formatted or not) as well as bounding boxes and class attributes.<br>
 In the default prompt setting, text content is represented as markdown, and math expressions as LaTeX, enclosed in \[..\] or \(..\). If a mathematical expression does not require LaTeX formatting to be represented (e.g., consisting only of characters and subscripts/superscripts), it is represented as markdown. Tables are represented as LaTeX. 
  Our AI models are designed and/or optimized to run on NVIDIA GPU-accelerated systems. By leveraging NVIDIA’s hardware (e.g. GPU cores) and software frameworks (e.g., CUDA libraries), the model achieves faster training and inference times compared to CPU-only solutions.<br>

Supported Hardware Microarchitecture Compatibility: <br>
NVIDIA Hopper/NVIDIA Ampere/NVIDIA Turing<br>

Supported Operating System(s): Linux<br>

The integration of foundation and fine-tuned models into AI systems requires additional testing using use-case-specific data to ensure safe and effective deployment. Following the V-model methodology, iterative testing and validation at both unit and system levels are essential to mitigate risks, meet technical and functional requirements, and ensure compliance with safety and ethical standards before deployment.<br>

from transformers import AutoModel, AutoProcessor, AutoTokenizer, AutoConfig, AutoImageProcessor, GenerationConfig
from postprocessing import extract_classes_bboxes, transform_bbox_to_original, postprocess_text

# Load model and processor
model_path = "nvidia/NVIDIA-Nemotron-Parse-v1.1"  # Or use a local path
device = "cuda:0"

model = AutoModel.from_pretrained(
    model_path,
    trust_remote_code=True,
    torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16
).to(device).eval()
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_path)
processor = AutoProcessor.from_pretrained(model_path, trust_remote_code=True)

# Load image
image = Image.open("path/to/your/image.jpg")
task_prompt = "</s><s><predict_bbox><predict_classes><output_markdown>"

# Process image
inputs = processor(images=[image], text=task_prompt, return_tensors="pt").to(device)
prompt_ids = processor.tokenizer.encode(task_prompt, return_tensors="pt", add_special_tokens=False).cuda()


generation_config = GenerationConfig.from_pretrained(model_path, trust_remote_code=True)
# Generate text
outputs = model.generate(**inputs,  generation_config=generation_config)

# Decode the generated text
generated_text = processor.batch_decode(outputs, skip_special_tokens=True)[0]
```
### Postprocessing

```python
from PIL import Image, ImageDraw
from postprocessing import extract_classes_bboxes, transform_bbox_to_original, postprocess_text

classes, bboxes, texts = extract_classes_bboxes(generated_text)
bboxes = [transform_bbox_to_original(bbox, image.width, image.height) for bbox in bboxes]

# Specify output formats for postprocessing
table_format = 'latex' # latex | HTML | markdown
text_format = 'markdown' # markdown | plain
blank_text_in_figures = False # remove text inside 'Picture' class
texts = [postprocess_text(text, cls = cls, table_format=table_format, text_format=text_format, blank_text_in_figures=blank_text_in_figures) for text, cls in zip(texts, classes)]

for cl, bb, txt in zip(classes, bboxes, texts):
    print(cl, ': ', txt)

draw = ImageDraw.Draw(image)
for bbox in bboxes:
  draw.rectangle((bbox[0], bbox[1], bbox[2], bbox[3]), outline="red")
```

## Inference with VLLM

**Update**: Nemotron-Parse-v1.1 is now [available in vllm main](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/30864) and can be found in [vllm/vllm-openai:nightly docker image](https://hub.docker.com/layers/vllm/vllm-openai/nightly/images/sha256-985e1e302332a505c3a90e1bbe85f8ae6e6cb47abea35ee2cbdc13fe7832e053). 

You will need to install *albumentations* on top, and then follow the VLLM Inference example below:
```bash
pip install albumentations
```

### VLLM Inference example

#### Option 1: end-to-end python inference
```python
from vllm import LLM, SamplingParams
from PIL import Image

def main():
    sampling_params = SamplingParams(
        temperature=0,
        top_k=1,
        repetition_penalty=1.1,
        max_tokens=9000,
        skip_special_tokens=False,
    )
    
    llm = LLM(
        model="nvidia/NVIDIA-Nemotron-Parse-v1.1",
        max_num_seqs=64,
        limit_mm_per_prompt={"image": 1},
        dtype="bfloat16",
        trust_remote_code=True,
    )
    
    image = Image.open("<YOUR-IMAGE-PATH>")
    
    prompts = [
        {  # Implicit prompt
            "prompt": "</s><s><predict_bbox><predict_classes><output_markdown>",
            "multi_modal_data": {
                "image": image
            },
        },
        {  # Explicit encoder/decoder prompt
            "encoder_prompt": {
                "prompt": "",
                "multi_modal_data": {
                    "image": image
                },
            },
            "decoder_prompt": "</s><s><predict_bbox><predict_classes><output_markdown>",
        },
    ]
    
    outputs = llm.generate(prompts, sampling_params)
    
    for output in outputs:
        prompt = output.prompt
        generated_text = output.outputs[0].text
        print(f"Decoder prompt: {prompt!r}, Generated text: {generated_text!r}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

#### Option 2: vllm serve

Alternatively, you can start a vllm server as:
```bash
vllm serve nvidia/NVIDIA-Nemotron-Parse-v1.1 \
    --dtype bfloat16 \
    --max-num-seqs 8 \
    --limit-mm-per-prompt '{"image": 1}' \
    --trust-remote-code \
    --port 8000 \
    --chat-template chat_template.jinja
```
with *chat_template.jinja* provided in this repository. Then, you can run inference as:

```python
import base64
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(
    base_url="http://localhost:8000/v1",
)

# Read and base64-encode the image
with open(<your-image-path>, "rb") as f:
    img_b64 = base64.b64encode(f.read()).decode("utf-8")

prompt_text = "</s><s><predict_bbox><predict_classes><output_markdown>"

resp = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="nvidia/NVIDIA-Nemotron-Parse-v1.1",
    messages=[
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": [
                {
                    "type": "text",
                    "text": prompt_text,
                },
                {
                    "type": "image_url",
                    "image_url": {
                        "url": f"data:image/png;base64,{img_b64}",
                    },
                },
            ],
        }
    ],
    max_tokens=9000,
    temperature=0.0,
    extra_body={
        "repetition_penalty": 1.1,
        "top_k": 1,
        "skip_special_tokens": False,
    },
)

print(resp.choices[0].message.content)
```

*Note:* we recommend using the default prompt that extracts bounding boxes, classes, and text in markdown formatting for all use cases (`</s><s><predict_bbox><predict_classes><output_markdown>`). If necessary, optionally the prompt that omits text extraction and only outputs bounding boxes and classes could be used: `</s><s><predict_bbox><predict_classes><output_no_text>`.

Nemotron-Parse-v1.1 is also available as an [optimized NIM container](https://build.nvidia.com/nvidia/nemotron-parse).

[**Deprecated**] An alternative way is to run vllm is with our fork (based on v0 vllm) according to installation instructions below, and then following the VLLM inference examples above:

<ul><ul><ul>

```bash
    uv venv --python 3.12 --seed
    source .venv/bin/activate
    uv pip install "git+https://github.com/amalad/vllm.git@nemotron_parse"
    uv pip install timm albumentations
```
</ul></ul></ul>
